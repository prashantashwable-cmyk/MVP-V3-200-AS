## Commands (filled in by Step 00)
Environment at baseline: Node v22.22.2, npm 10.9.7, OpenJDK 21.0.10, firebase-tools 15.31.0 (via `npx`), Chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers`.
Package manager: **npm** (`package-lock.json`). `bun.lock` is kept for now; Step 01 decides whether to delete it.

| Purpose | Command | Works in the cloud session? |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `npm ci` (the SessionStart hook `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` runs it automatically) | Yes, ~13-19 s cold, 0 s when already installed |
| Dev server | `npm run dev` (Express + Vite middleware on port 3000) | Yes, HTTP 200 within ~3 s. Warns that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unset and falls back to demo mode |
| Type check / lint | `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) | Yes, pass, ~9 s |
| Build | `npm run build` (vite build + esbuild server bundle) | Yes, pass, ~19 s |
| MVP checks | `npm run mvp:checks` (Step 03 creates it) | Not yet |
| Legacy checks | run each non-`live-*` script from `npm run checks` individually (loop below). **Never** run `npm run checks` as a whole: it includes `live-*` scripts | Yes, 42/42 pass, ~104 s total |
| Emulator | `npx -y firebase-tools@15.31.0 emulators:exec --config firebase.emulator.json --project demo-aie-mvp --only firestore,auth,storage "<cmd>"` | Yes, starts in ~19 s (first run downloads the emulator JARs) |
| E2E | Playwright is not installed as a dependency. Chromium is at `$PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers`. Do not run `playwright install` | Browser available; no E2E harness yet |

Legacy-check loop (skips `lint` and every `live-*` script):
```bash
for s in $(node -e 'console.log(require("./package.json").scripts.checks.split("&&").map(s=>s.trim().replace("npm run ","")).join(" "))'); do
  case $s in lint|live-*) continue;; esac
  npm run $s >/tmp/$s.log 2>&1 && echo "PASS $s" || echo "FAIL $s"
done
git checkout -- docs/architecture docs/migration docs/production  # some checks rewrite "Regenerated:" dates
```

## Baseline (filled in by Step 00, before any code change)
Taken on 2026-09-24 at `main` `fc505b8`, with no application code changed.

| Command | Result | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | PASS | 9 s |
| `npm run build` | PASS (large-bundle warning only) | 19 s |
| 42 non-live checks from `npm run checks` | 42 PASS / 0 FAIL | 104 s total |
| `npm run dev` + `curl localhost:3000` | HTTP 200, title "AIEC — All India Elevators" | ~3 s to ready |
| Emulator `emulators:exec ... "echo ok"` | PASS (`ok`, exit 0) | 19 s |

- Checks that passed at baseline: all 42 non-live scripts in the `checks` chain: domain, workflow:validate, repository, authz, audit, eventbus, commercial, operations, surfaces, offline, reliability, controltower, e2e, migration, bridge, procurement-bridge, delivery-bridge, installation-qc-handover-bridge, portal-summary, operating-surfaces-home, project-operating-view, work-queue, production-demo-gate (20 s), production-bundle-bypass (36 s), legacy-authz-remediation, destructive-action-safety, transactional-idempotency, hard-gate-attack, dual-write-reconciliation, dual-write-cutover, legacy-read-migration, legacy-write-reduction, legacy-database-elimination, final-company-simulation-multi, code-splitting (17 s), security-hardening, integration-boundaries, global-search, data-quality-phase26, dbmanager-remaining, navigation-cutover, simulation:full-company. Each ran against the in-memory demo repository (`environment: 'demo'`). None touched Firestore.
- Checks that failed at baseline (pre-existing, not ours): none.
- Checks skipped (need credentials / touch the real project): `live-firebase-auth:check`, `live-firestore-authz:check`, `live-concurrency-idempotency:check`, `live-e2e:check` (all `live-*`, D-19).
- Side effect: `dual-write-reconciliation`, `dual-write-cutover`, `legacy-read-migration`, `legacy-database-elimination` and the migration matrix rewrite the `Regenerated:` date in 5 docs under `docs/architecture`, `docs/migration` and `docs/production`. Revert those after running them.

## Decision changes (Owner-approved deviations from DECISIONS.md)
| Date | Decision | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|---|

## Open issues / known gaps
| # | Issue | Found in step | Severity | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Emulator tooling (Java, firebase-tools, emulator JARs) is not cached in the image. Each fresh session downloads firebase-tools (~27 s) and the JARs (~10 s) on first use | 00 | Low | Optional: add the setup-script lines from the kit README to the environment to preinstall them |
| 2 | `emulator/storage.rules` is an emulator-only placeholder (signed-in users can read and write). The repo has no real `storage.rules` | 00 | Medium | Step 11 designs real Storage rules |
| 3 | Some legacy checks rewrite "Regenerated:" dates in tracked docs | 00 | Low | Revert after running; Step 01 can decide whether to keep these generators |
| 4 | Both `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json` exist. npm was chosen (package-lock updated most recently in phase 57; `bun.lock` was last touched in phase 17; the earlier pack's logs use npm) | 00 | Low | Step 01 audit decides whether to delete `bun.lock` |

## Step notes
<!-- Claude appends one block per step: what changed, checks run and their results, deviations, follow-ups. -->

### Step 00: Bootstrap and baseline (2026-09-24)
- Installed the kit from the zip attached to the session: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/mvp/*` (including `future/`), `.claude/agents/mvp-scope-guard.md`, and `docs/mvp/prompts/` (00–14 plus `utilities/U1–U5`). There was no earlier root `CLAUDE.md`, so nothing needed merging.
- Added the SessionStart hook: `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` and `.claude/settings.json`. It runs only when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`, runs `npm ci` when `node_modules` is missing or older than `package-lock.json`, and skips otherwise. Tested cold (13 s) and warm (0 s).
- Added emulator-only config (D-19): `firebase.emulator.json` (Auth 9099, Firestore 8080, Storage 9199, UI off, uses the existing `firestore.rules`) and `emulator/storage.rules`. These always run under the `demo-aie-mvp` project ID, so they cannot reach a real project. There is no `firebase.json` or `.firebaserc`, and no production Firebase setting was changed.
- No application code changed. No `live-*` script was run.
